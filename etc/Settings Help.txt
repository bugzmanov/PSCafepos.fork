The files located in this directory are the settings used to run PSCAFEPOS.

+ The active file is always named "settings.dbp"

+ The templace file that is used when no "settings.dbp" exists is "settings.dbp.firstrun"

+ The other files are template files for tested SIS Systems.
	Note: These are not completely configured, they will need information
              such as IP address, etc.  First, rename the file you would like
              to use to "settings.dbp" and execute the "PSCAFEPOS.bat --config"
	      This forces the configuration wizard to load.
